  <i>Port Scanner Scans For Open Ports</i>
</p>

<h2 align="center">What is Port Scanner</h2>

<p align="center">
  A port scanner is a computer program that checks network ports for one of three possible statuses â€“ open, closed, or filtered. It is an application designed to probe a server or host for open ports. Port scanners are valuable tools in diagnosing network and connectivity issues. They can be used by administrators to verify security policies of their networks and by attackers to identify network services running on a host and exploit vulnerabilities. They can also be used by security analysts to confirm network security policies.
